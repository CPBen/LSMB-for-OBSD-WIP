MVP is a mechanism for loading configuration (or other information) for
libraries. It doesn't read a file or a database.
It's a helper for things that do.

The idea is that you end up with a Config::MVP::Sequence object, and
that you can use that object to fully configure your library or
application. The sequence will contain a bunch of Config::MVP::Section
objects, each of which is meant to provide configuration for a part of
your program. Most of these sections will be directly related to a Perl
library that you'll use as a plugin or helper. Each section will have a
name, and every name in the sequence will be unique.

This is a pretty abstract set of behaviors, so we'll provide some more
concrete examples that should help explain how things work.
