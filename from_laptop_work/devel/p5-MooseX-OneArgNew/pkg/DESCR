MooseX::OneArgNew lets your constructor take a single argument, which
will be translated into the value for a one-entry hashref.
It is a parameterized role with three parameters:

type

    The Moose type that the single argument must be for the one-arg form
    to work. This should be an existing type, and may be either a string
    type or a MooseX::Type.

init_arg

    This is the string that will be used as the key for the hashref
    constructed from the one-arg call to new.

coerce

    If true, a single argument to new will be coerced into the expected
    type if possible. Keep in mind that if there are no coercions for
    the type, this will be an error, and that if a coercion from HashRef
    exists, you might be getting yourself into a weird situation.
