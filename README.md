# LSMB-for-OBSD-WIP
Porting in Perl modules to OpenBSD that are WIP.

Any work found under cpan directories are generated by a port generator program.
These are a good start, but are not yet ready for submission to ports@openbsd.org.
Look at the porting guides at the top of the FAQ page of the OpenBSD site.
