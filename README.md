# LSMB-for-OBSD-WIP
Porting in Perl modules to OpenBSD that are WIP.

Any work found under cpan directories are generated by a port generator program.
These are a good start, but are not yet ready for submission to ports@openbsd.org.
Look at the porting guides at the top of the FAQ page of the OpenBSD site.
https://www.openbsd.org/faq/index.html

Please be sure to mention that any ports you submit are specifically for LedgerSMB
upcoming release! Porting work must run with the latest version of -current and the
latest version of the ports tree or work may not be accepted. If you do not get an
immediate response, please submit a "ping" after a week or two. This is very commonly
needed due to a small and very busy group of committers that review the work.
