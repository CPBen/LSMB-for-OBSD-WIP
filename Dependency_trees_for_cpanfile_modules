This is a token file to point out that each cpanfile module produces a
tree of dependencies that may be really long and complicated.

To make this tree submitable, the lowest level dependencies need to be
worked on first, otherwise work higher up can't get done.

I have found this a bit complicated and I want to add some sort of easily
understood pathway to make working on this simpler.

I'm not sure of the best way to outline this. Suggestions welcome.
Any help of any kind is welcome. No need to actually port in a module is
necessary. For example, I don't have experience with some of the web server
setups.

Pointing out changes to the cpanfile itself is great help. So is pointing
out any CPAN module that gets added to base OpenBSD helps too!

Thanks.
